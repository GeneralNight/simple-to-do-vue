## The Ideia
<p>
  I was looking for a way to improve my github and show my current skills so, here we are. <br>
  The concept of the project is simple, but here the ideia is show I'm able to make vue applications, as I already make.<br>
  Here we have only one task list, but there's some tools that makes this project unique.
</p>

## Tools and requirements
* User can give a title to the to-do list
* User can edit this title
* User can reset title to default if title is too long or if user is lazy
* User can add new items to list
* User can check the list items
* User can remove items from list
* User can toggle between light and dark mode

## Trivia about the project 
<p>
  It was make in less than 3 hours.<br>
  Here, I don't wanna sound rude, but actually i would show that, when we dominate something, we can make things like that!<br>
